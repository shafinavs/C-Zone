    <h1>Identify the "Gap"</h1>
    <p>Support usually fails in one of three ways. Pinpoint which one you're missing:</p>
    <p>Resource Support: You don't have the tools, time, or data to do the job.</p>
    <p>Clarity Support: You don’t know exactly what is expected of you.</p>
    <p>Emotional Support: You feel isolated or unappreciated by your team/boss.</p>
    <h2>Make "The Ask" (Be Specific)</h2>
    <p>Vague complaints like "I need more help" usually get ignored. Be surgically precise</p>
    <p>Instead of: "I'm overwhelmed."</p>
    <p>Try: "I have five tasks but only time for three. Which two should I de-prioritize?"</p>
    <p>Instead of: "No one is helping me."</p>
    <p>Try: "I need 15 minutes of your technical expertise to get past this specific roadblock."</p>
