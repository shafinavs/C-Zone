    <h1>The "Just Five" Rule</h1>
    <p>Don't try to finish the whole project. Tell yourself you will work for exactly five minutes and then you can quit.</p><br>
    <p>Why it works: Usually, the fear of starting is worse than the task itself. Once you're five minutes in, the "mental itch" to finish kicks in.</p><br>
    <h2>  Shrink the Task</h2>
    <p> If your task is "Write the Report," it's too big. Your brain will hide from it. Break it down until it feels almost stupidly easy:</p><br>
    <p>Bad: Write the report,</p>
    <p>Good: Open a Word doc.</p>
    <p>Better: Type the header and save the file</p>
