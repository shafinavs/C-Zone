    <h1>Normalize Radical Candor</h1>
    <p>Often, miscommunication happens because people are afraid to be "rude" by asking for clarity or admitting they don't understand.</p><br>
    <p>Encourage Questions: Leaders should end every meeting with "What did I explain poorly?" instead of "Any questions?"</p><br>
    <p>Assume Positive Intent: If a message sounds blunt or rude, give the sender the benefit of the doubt. Text lacks tone; a quick "Hey, just checking—did you mean for this to come across as urgent?" can clear the air.</p><br>
    <h2>The "Closed-Loop" Communication Method</h2>
    <p>This is the single most effective way to ensure a message was received correctly.</p><br>
    <p>The Script: "Just to make sure we’re on the same page, you want me to prioritize the slide deck over the data analysis, and you need the final version by Thursday at 2 PM. Is that right?"</p><br>
    <p>The Result: It catches misunderstandings immediately rather than three days later</p><br>
