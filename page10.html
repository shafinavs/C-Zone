    <h1>The Brain Dump</h1>
    <p>Anxiety grows when tasks stay in your head.</p>
    <p>The Fix: Write down everything you’re worried about (exams, chores, emails).</p>
    <p>Once it’s on paper, your brain stops "looping" the same stressful thoughts.</p>
    <h2>Focus on Next, Not All</h2>
    <p>Don't look at the whole semester or the entire final exam.</p>
    <p>The Fix: Ask, What is the one thing I need to do in the next hour?</p>
    <p>Just read two pages. Just solve one problem. Small wins kill anxiety.</p>
