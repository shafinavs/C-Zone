   <h1>Create a "Shutdown" Ritual</h1>
   <p>Anxiety usually comes from thinking about study while you’re trying to relax.</p>
   <p>The Fix: Pick a specific time to stop (e.g., 7:00 PM).</p>
   <p>Physically close your books, clear your desk, and say out loud: "I am done for today."</p>
   <h2>The Quality over Quantity Rule</h2>
   <p>Four hours of distracted studying is worse than one hour of deep focus.</p>
   <P>The Fix: Use the Pomodoro Technique (25 mins work / 5 mins break).</P>
   <p>When you are "on," focus 100%. When you are "off," leave your desk. Don't scroll through social media at your study space.</p>
