    <h1>Set One "Hard Stop"</h1>
    <p>Self-care is often just about saying "no" to more work.</p>
    <p>Pick a time: At 6:00 PM (or whenever your shift ends), close the laptop.</p>
    <p>Physically move: Change out of your "work clothes" immediately to signal to your brain that the day is over.</p>
    <h2>The Emergency Self-Care List</h2>
    <p>Fresh Air: Open a window or step outside for 2 minutes</p>
    <p>Movement: Stretch your neck and shoulders right now</p>
    <p>Quiet: Turn off all notifications for 30 minutes.</p>
