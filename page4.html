     <h1>Immediate tactical fixes</h1>
     <p>Five-Minute Buffer: Don't jump directly from one meeting to the next. Give yourself five minutes to stretch, hydrate, or stare out a window. It resets your cognitive load.</p><br>
     <p>Box Breathing: It sounds cliché, but it’s a physiological hack. Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. It signals your nervous system to exit "fight or flight" mode.</p><br>
     <p>Single-Tasking: Multitasking is a myth that increases error rates and anxiety. Pick one task, set a timer for 25 minutes (the Pomodoro technique), and ignore everything else.</p>
     <br><br>
     <h2>Mindset and environment</h2>
     <p>Curate Your Space: A cluttered desk often leads to a cluttered mind. Spend 10 minutes at the end of the day clearing your physical workspace.</p><br>
     <p>Seek Social Support: You don’t need to be best friends with your coworkers, but a quick vent session or a "sanity check" with a peer can remind you that you’re not alone in the chaos.</p><br>
     <p>Reframe the "Mistake": In high-pressure roles, we often catastrophize. Ask yourself: "Will this matter in six months?" Usually, the answer is no.</p><br>
