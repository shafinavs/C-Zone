    <h1>The Top 3 Rule</h1>
    <p>Your To-Do list is likely too long, which causes paralysis.</p>
    <p>The Fix: Pick only three things that must happen today.</p>
    <p>Everything else is a "bonus" if you get to it.</p>
    <h2>Use Time Boxing</h2>
    <p>Stop working until a task is "done." Work until the timer goes off</p>
    <p>The Fix: Set a timer for 25 or 50 minutes for one specific task.</p>
    <p>When it beeps, stop. Take a 5-minute break. This prevents tasks from "bleeding" into your whole day.</p>
