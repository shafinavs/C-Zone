    <h1>The "Blurting" Method</h1>
    <p>Don’t just re-read your notes; that’s a trap that makes you feel like you know it when you don't.</p>
    <p>The Fix: Read a page, close the book, and write down everything you remember on a blank sheet.</p>
    <p>The Gap: Go back and see what you missed. The "struggle" to remember is what actually builds the memory.</p>
    <h2>Spaced Repetition</h2>
    <p>Your brain is designed to forget things it doesn't use. You have to remind it before the memory fades.</p>
    <p>The Schedule: Review the material after 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week, then 1 month.</p>
    <p>Why it works: This fights the "Forgetting Curve," which shows how quickly we lose data if we don't revisit it.</p>
