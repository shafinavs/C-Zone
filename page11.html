    <h1>The 2-Minute Rule</h1>
    <p>If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.</p>
    <p>Why: Thinking about it takes more energy than just doing it.</p>
    <p>Example: Sending a quick RSVP or putting a dish in the dishwasher</p>
    <h2>Forgive Yourself</h2>
    <p>Studies show that students who forgive themselves for procrastinating on the first exam actually study more for the second one.</p>
    <p>The Fix: If you wasted the morning, don't waste the afternoon by feeling guilty. Start fresh at 1:00 PM.</p>
